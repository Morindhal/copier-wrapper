# Roadmap
## TODO:
1. Support all relevant switches as described in `copier -h`.
2. Add stubs for being able to pre-process, post-process and just process the input data.
3. Add rust-docs to this crate.
4. Add/relay error messages and other relevant feedback.

# Requirements
Currently requires a working copier command in the PATH env-variable.
